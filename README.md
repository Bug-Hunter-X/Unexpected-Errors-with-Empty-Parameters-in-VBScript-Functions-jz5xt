This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in VBScript: unexpected errors arising from empty or improperly typed parameters passed to functions.  The `bug.vbs` file contains a function that lacks robust error handling for empty parameters, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides an improved version with explicit error checking and more resilient type handling.  The solution showcases how to use the `IsEmpty` function and `Err.Raise` for improved error handling and clearer error messages.  This makes the code more stable and easier to debug.
